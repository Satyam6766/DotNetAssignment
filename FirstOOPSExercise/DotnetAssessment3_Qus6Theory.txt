Qus5)How to preventing Derived class from overriding virtual members?
Ans)
Type1
If none of its members are marked virtual, derived classes will not be able to overrides its members. 

                    public class Box
                    { 
	                public string Name {get;set;}  
	                public int Length{get;set;}  
                        public int Breadth{get;set;}     
                	
                        public void Area() {
                        Console.WriteLine("Area of Box will be:"+(Length*Breadth));
                        }
                     } 
Here Method is Not marked as Virtual so cannot be overriden.

Type2
If you want to prevent it from being inherited, you can mark the class as sealed.
              public Sealed class Box                //Class marked as sealed
                    { 
	                public string Name {get;set;}  
	                public int Length{get;set;}  
                        public int Breadth{get;set;}     
                	
                        public void Area() {
                        Console.WriteLine("Area of Box will be:"+(Length*Breadth));
                        }
                     } 
Here class itself is marked as sealed so none of its method can be overriden.

Type3
If you want to prevent a method you have overridden from being further overridden in sub classes,
 you can mark the method sealed like.

        public class Bird 
        { 
	       public string Name {get;} 
     
               public int Age {get;} 
	 
	
               public virtual void Chirp() {}  //CAN BE OVERRIDDEN 
         } 
 
       //Anyone who inherits from Indian_peafowl cannot override chirp method
       public class Indian_peafowl : Bird 
       { 
       public sealed override void Chirp() {
       Performing some task here.
       } 
       }
