Qus5)What is virtual method in c# ?
Ans)Virtual method is a method that can be redefined in derived classes.
 In C#, a virtual method has an implementation in a base class as well as in 
derived class[Optional to redefine in derived class]. 

It is used when a method's basic functionality is same but sometimes more functionality is needed in the derived class.
 We create a virtual method in the base class using the virtual keyword and that method is overriden in the derived class
 using the override keyword.
 
When a method is declared as a virtual method in a base class then that method can be defined in a base class
and it is optional for the derived class to override that method. 
It is also an example for polymorphism.
