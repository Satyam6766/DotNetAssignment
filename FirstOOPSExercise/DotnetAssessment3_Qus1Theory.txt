Qus1)What is the difference between abstract class and interface ?
Ans)
Abstract class:
It is must to have one abstract method inside abstract class,and then any number of abstract and non-abstract method 
can  be declared[in case of some more abstract method] and defined[in case of non abstract method].

1>Multiple inheritance is not possible to  achieved through classes{Abstract}.
2>Abstract classes contains both declaration and definition part.
3>Abstract classes contain constructor.	
4>Abstract classes can contain static members.
5>Abstract classes can contain different types of access modifiers like public, private, protected etc.	
6>A class can only inherit one abstract class.


Interface:
Here in interface we can just declare methods,not possible to define them.
Like classes,here it is not mendatory to put abstract keyword before methods.
It is because bydefault all methods declared under interface are abstract.

1>Multiple inheritance is achieved by interface.
2>Interface contains only a declaration part.
3>Interface does not contain constructor.
4>Interface does not contain static members
5>Interface only contains public access modifier because everything in the interface is public.
6>A class can inherit multiple interface.
