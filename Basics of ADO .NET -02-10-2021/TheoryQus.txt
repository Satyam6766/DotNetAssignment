Qus1)Describe all the data provider objects with sample code?
Ans)Data provider is used to connect to the database, execute commands and retrieve the record. 
    It is lightweight component with better performance. It also allows us to place the data into DataSet
    to use it further in our application.


Following are the core object of Data Providers:
Object	        Description
--------        -----------
Connection	It is used to establish a connection to a specific data source.
Command	        It is used to execute queries to perform database operations.
DataReader	DataReader is used to read the data from the database and it is a read and forward only 
                connection oriented architecture during fetch the data from database. 
                DataReader will fetch the data very fast when compared with dataset .
                The DbDataReader is a base class for all DataReader objects.
DataAdapter	It populates a DataSet and resolves updates with the data source. The base class for all DataAdapter objects is the DbDataAdapter class.

The .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server classes is located in the System.Data.SqlClient namespace.

 NAMESPACE:   using System.Data.SqlClient;    

This namespace contains the following important classes.

Class	        Description
SqlConnection	It is used to create SQL Server connection. This class cannot be inherited.
SqlCommand	It is used to execute database queries. This class cannot be inherited.
SqlDataAdapter	It represents a set of data commands and a database connection that are used to fill the DataSet. This class cannot be inherited.
SqlDataReader	It is used to read rows from a SQL Server database. This class cannot be inherited.
SqlException	This class is used to throw SQL exceptions. It throws an exception when an error is occurred. This class cannot be inherited.

Qus4)What are the two architecture in ado .net for connection create a connection, implement both architecture 
     and show the difference?
Ans)In C#, we work in two different ways with database connectivity. As you know when we create software or website 
    or any other application which is connected to the database we need to make connection to the database to get data. 
    Here you can get data in two different ways.

    Either it can be connected architecture where you go and connect to the database and get data or disconnected architecture
    where you connect to the database first time and get all data in an object and use it if required. 
    You can perform any action like insert, update, and search on this.

    You can use two C# objects to achieve this,
    first one is DataSet [DISCONNECTED ARCHITECTURE]
    and other one is DataReader.[CONNECTION ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE]
