Qus9)What are the methods of XML dataset objects
Ans)The DataSet class in .NET plays a major role by providing a disconnected data access model.  
    There are situations when we might not require a database to store data.  Rather, we may store the data in an XML file.
    Microsoft .NET provides support for designing such applications with the help of the DataSet class 
    in the System.Data namespace. 

 ADO.NET DataSet XML methods
Method            Description

GetXml(  )        Retrieves the XML representation of the data in the DataSet as a single string.

GetXmlSchema(  )  Retrieves the XSD schema for the DataSet XML as a single string. No data is returned.

ReadXml(  )       Reads XML data from a file or a TextReader, XmlReader, or Stream object, and uses it to populate the DataSet. The XML document can include an inline schema.

ReadXmlSchema(  ) Reads an XML schema from a file or a TextReader, XmlReader, or Stream object, and uses it to configure the DataSet (for example, creating Constraint and DataColumn objects).

WriteXml(  )      Writes the contents of the DataSet to a file or a TextWriter, XmlWriter, or Stream object. You can choose to write the schema inline.

WriteXmlSchema( ) Writes just the XSD schema describing the contents of the DataSet to a file or a TextWriter, XmlWriter, or Stream object.

InferXmlSchema() Infers the XML schema and applies it to the DataSet by reading through an XML document supplied by a file or a TextReader, XmlReader, or Stream object.
