Qus9)What is the difference between DataReader, DataAdapter, and DataSet?
Ans)DataReader, DataSet, and DataAdapter are major components of ADO.NET
  
 DataReader
 DataReader is used to read the data from the database and it is a read and forward only connection oriented architecture
 during fetch the data from database. DataReader will fetch the data very fast when compared with dataset. 
 Generally, we will use ExecuteReader object to bind data to datareader.

 SAMPLE CODE:
 protected void BindGrid() {
    using(SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("ConnectionString")) {
        con.Open();
        SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("Select UserName, First Name,LastName,Location FROM Users", conn);
        SqlDataReader sdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
        gvUserInfo.DataSource = sdr;
        gvUserInfo.DataBind();
        conn.Close();
    }
}

  DataSet
  DataSet is a disconnected orient architecture that means there is no need of active connections during work with 
  datasets and it is a collection of DataTables and relations between tables. It is used to hold multiple tables with data.
  You can select data form tables, create views based on table and ask child rows over relations. 
  Also DataSet provides you with rich features like saving data as XML and loading XML data.



  DataAdapter
  DataAdapter will acts as a Bridge between DataSet and database. This dataadapter object is used to read the data
  from database and bind that data to dataset. Dataadapter is a disconnected oriented architecture. 
  
 SAMPLE CODE:Will give idea about both DataAdapter and DataSet
 
 protected void BindGridview() {
    SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("Data Source=abc;Integrated Security=true;Initial Catalog=Test");
    conn.Open();
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("Select UserName, First Name,LastName,Location FROM Users", conn);
    SqlDataAdapter sda = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);
    DataSet ds = new DataSet();
    sda.Fill(ds);
    gvUserInfo.DataSource = ds;
    gvUserInfo.DataBind();
}
